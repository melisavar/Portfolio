<p><i>By Melisa Var</i></p>

<p>Greetings! 	My name is Melisa Var. Above is a table of my past experiences.<br>
I am currently on my second year at Bachelors of Computer Science at Dalhousie University.<br>
</p></b>
<p><b>Learning is a Passion</b></p>

<p>Being a computer science student comes with a lot of responsibilites. I've always been interested in coding and playing with numbers. Recently I took a course at Dalhousie<br>
and had experiences with SQL. This made me realize that I want to become a data analyst and turn this interest into a real story by practising more and exploring all the <br>
features of data analytics.</p>
